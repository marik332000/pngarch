<h1>PNG Archiver</h1>
<p>
<strong>PNG Archiver</strong> is a library (pngdat) and command line
tool (pngarch) for storing data inside a <a
href="http://www.libpng.org/">PNG</a> image. The inspiration for this
idea comes from Sean Howard's Gameplay Mechanics. This idea is from <a
href="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">Mechanic #12</a>:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">
<p>
The idea is that data can be embedded into image files (similar to a
bar-code, but not having to pander to a single horizontal line
scanner) in order to make sharing of data easier.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Images are the easiest file format to share on the Internet, and
anywhere where you can share a file, you can always share an
image. With the PNG Archiver, you can store any data you want in the
image.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Currently, the tool can only handle 24-bit (8-bit depth) RGB,
non-alpha PNGs. As I develop the tool, it will gain the ability to
embed data in any type of PNG (using larger areas of the image for
images with lower bit depth). The tool and library will also have
built in error checking to make sure that the image has not been
damaged. An image may be damaged if it was converted to a lossy image
format (such as JPEG).
</p>
<p>
Eventually (before 1.0) the tool and library will also be able to pull
image data from anywhere in the image. This means that you can embed
the data in a nice frame that is relevant to the data.
</p>
<h3>Why PNG?</h3>
<p>
PNG was selected because it is a non-lossy, standard image format
common on the Web. It uses the <a href="http://www.libpng.org"> libpng
</a> library to access the images.
</p>
<p>
JPEG could not be used because it is a lossy image format. GIF isn't
lossy, but it sucks (having only a limited 256 color palette). Why
would you want to use GIF for anything? (GIF animations are annoying,
so this does not count)
<p>
<p>
All data is stored in the visible pixels of the image; no data is
stored in the image meta data. This means that you could take a
screenshot (assuming that your display is at a minimum bit depth for
that image) and extract the data directly from the screenshot.
</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<h3>Alpha Release 0.1</h3>
<p>
This is the first alpha release of the program. It lacks a lot of the
functionality that will be in release 1.0. <strong>The format of the
data in the PNG is subject to change. Images created with this release
may not be readable in future releases.</strong>
