<h1>PNG Archiver</h1>
<p>
<strong>PNG Archiver</strong> is a library (<code>pngdat</code>) and
command line tool (<code>pngarch</code>) for storing data inside a <a
href="http://www.libpng.org/">PNG</a> image. The inspiration for this
idea comes from Sean Howard's Gameplay Mechanics. This idea is from <a
href="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">Mechanic #12</a>:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">
<p>
The idea is that data can be embedded into image files (similar to a
bar-code, but not having to pander to a single horizontal line
scanner) in order to make sharing of data easier.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Images are the easiest file format to share on the Internet, and
anywhere where you can share a file, you can always share an
image. With the PNG Archiver, you can store any data you want in the
image.
</p>
<p>
For example, here is Richard Stallman's <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html"> Right to
Read</a>:<br/>
<img src="right-to-read.txt.png"><br/>
and gzipped (more colorful than plain ASCII):<br/>
<img src="right-to-read.txt_gz.png"><br/>
The original text file can be found here: 
<a href="right-to-read.txt">right-to-read.txt</a> (13KB).
</p>
<p>
The built-in PNG compression doesn't do much for this non-image
data. This is why you should compress data before archiving it in a
PNG.
</p>
<p>
A decent amount of data can be stored in an image. 1.4MB can be stored
in an 800x600 8-bit depth image. If you want to push the limits, you
can store about 4.5MB in a 1024x768 16-bit depth image (a typical
desktop wallpaper). That is enough to store several minutes of audio
recording.
</p>
<p>
This tool has the word "archive" in its name. However, this
technically is not an archiving tool. Only a single file can be
embedded using this tool. This means you need an external archiving
tool, such as <code>tar</code> or <code>zip</code>, if you want to
store multiple files. The purpose of this limitation was so that the
PNG Archiver does not duplicate the functionality of other tools that
already do an excellent job of archiving.
</p>
<p>
The word/acronym "PNG" is pronounced "ping". This means that this tool
is called the "ping archiver". Really, you can call it whatever you
want. This is just some advice to help you avoid confusion later on.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Current Limitations</h3>
<p>
Currently, the tool can only handle 24-bit (8-bit depth) RGB,
non-alpha PNG's. As I develop the tool, it will gain the ability to
embed data in any type of PNG (using larger areas of the image for
images with lower bit depth). The tool and library will also have
built in error checking to make sure that the image has not been
damaged. An image may be damaged if it was converted to a lossy image
format (such as JPEG). The PNG archives are also currently limited to
the architecture of the machine. For example, you cannot create a PNG
archive on a PowerPC and extract it on a Pentium. This will be fixed
soon.
</p>
<p>
Eventually (before 1.0) the tool and library will also be able to pull
image data from anywhere in the image. This means that you can embed
the data in a nice frame that is relevant to the data (see Sean's
Gameplay Mechanics page).
</p>
<p>
Also, the library is currently not separated as a library from the
<code>pngarch</code> tool. As the library is developed, this will be
done.
</p>
<h3>Why PNG?</h3>
<p>
PNG was selected because it is a non-lossy, standard image format
common on the Web. It uses the <a href="http://www.libpng.org"> libpng
</a> library to access the images.
</p>
<p>
JPEG could not be used because it is a lossy image format. GIF isn't
lossy, but it sucks (having only a limited 256 color palette). Why
would you want to use GIF for anything? (GIF animations are annoying,
so this does not count)
<p>
<p>
All data is stored in the visible pixels of the image; no data is
stored in the image meta data. This means that you could take a
screenshot (assuming that your display is at a minimum bit depth for
that image) and extract the data directly from the screenshot.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Currently, the tool can archive any file inside of a PNG file and
extract that file from the PNG into an identical file. More options
will be available as I continue working on the tool. Here are the
current command line switches,
</p>
<pre>
Usage: pngarch [options] [files]

Options:

  -c, --create     Create data PNG
  -x, --extract    Extract data PNG
  -w, --width      Width of the image (default 250)
  -h, --height     Height of the image (default 0)
  -t, --list       List internal filename
  -V, --verbose    Enable verbose output
  -v, --version    Display version information
  -h, --help       Display this help text
</pre>
<p>
The filename of the file archived in the PNG is stored within the PNG
itself. When extracting, the extracted data is put in a file with this
name. For example,
</p>
<pre>
$ pngarch my_file.txt
</pre>
<p>
will create a PNG file <code>my_file.txt.png</code>. Even if this file
is renamed, the PNG will know what file to extract to (-V for verbose),
</p>
<pre>
$ mv my_file.txt.png a_file.txt.png
$ pngarch a_file.txt.png
Extracted my_file.txt
$ 
</pre>
<p>
The interface is very similar to <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">
<code>gzip</code></a>. When you don't tell it exactly what to do, it
will figure it out based on the file extension.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
All downloads, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">
md5</a> checksums can be found in <a href="files/">files/</a>.
</p>
<p>
There will not be any official binaries until at least release
1.0. Even at that point, there may not be any. However, due to the
complexity of building on w32, I may provide those binaries at that
time (if I can figure out how to build it for w32, or someone else
does it for me).
</p>
<h3>Alpha Release 0.1 (2007-06-18)</h3>
<p>
This is the first alpha release of the program. It lacks a lot of the
functionality that will be in release 1.0. <strong>The format of the
data in the PNG is subject to change. Images created with this release
may not be readable in future releases.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Source tarball: 
<a href="files/pngarch-0.1.tar.gz">datpng-0.1.tar.gz</a> (79KB)<br/>
Source PNG Archive (for fun):<br/>
<img src="files/pngarch-0.1.tar_gz.png"><br/>
</p>
<p>
The source uses the GNU build system. To build the source you will
need a C compiler (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"> gcc </a>
recommended), a bourne shell (such as <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"> bash </a>), and the libpng
library. You can compile with the regular commands:
</p>
<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>
<p>
You can install (with <code>make install</code>), but there is no need
to yet because you should only be using the tools for testing right
now.
</p>
<h3>Subversion Repository</h3>
<p>
You can also grab the latest source right from the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository:
</p>
<pre>
svn co https://opensvn.csie.org/datpng/trunk datpng
</pre>
<p>
To build from the repository, you will need <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/"> autoconf </a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/"> automake </a>. To get
the build environment up to date, run the command,
</p>
<pre>
autoreconf -i
</pre>
<p>
Then you can go through the regular build process.
