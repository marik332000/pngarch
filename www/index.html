Embedded in the image below is the audio recording of a blue whale. It
was produced using the PNG Archiver. The audio sample can also be
extracted using the PNG Archiver.<br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<strong>PNG Archiver</strong> is a library (<code>pngdat</code>) and
command line tool (<code>pngarch</code>) for storing data inside a <a
href="http://www.libpng.org/">PNG</a> image. The inspiration for this
idea comes from Sean Howard's Gameplay Mechanics. This idea is from <a
href="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">Mechanic #12</a>:
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=12">
<p>
The idea is that data can be embedded into image files (similar to a
bar-code, but not having to pander to a single horizontal line
scanner) in order to make sharing of data easier.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Images are the easiest file format to share on the Internet, and
anywhere where you can share a file, you can always share an
image. With the PNG Archiver, you can store any data you want in the
image. A built-in checksum checks the data integrity when extracting
the data from an image.
</p>
<p>
For example, here is Richard Stallman's <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html"> Right to
Read</a>:<br />
<img src="right-to-read-text.png" alt="PNG Archive" /><br />
and gzipped (more colorful than plain ASCII):<br />
<img src="right-to-read-gz.png" alt="PNG Archive" /><br />
The original text file can be found here: 
<a href="right-to-read.txt">right-to-read.txt</a> (13KB).
</p>
<p>
The built-in PNG compression doesn't do much for this non-image
data. This is why you should compress data before archiving it in a
PNG. This will also make the image dimensions smaller.
</p>
<p>
A decent amount of data can be stored in an image. 1.4MB can be stored
in an 800x600 8-bit depth image. If you want to push the limits, you
can store about 4.5MB in a 1024x768 16-bit depth image (a typical
desktop wallpaper). That is enough to store several minutes of audio
recording.
</p>
<p>
This tool has the word "archive" in its name. However, this
technically is not an archiving tool. Only a single file can be
embedded using this tool. This means you need an external archiving
tool, such as <code>tar</code> or <code>zip</code>, if you want to
store multiple files. The purpose of this limitation was so that the
PNG Archiver does not duplicate the functionality of other tools that
already do an excellent job of archiving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The PNG Archiver is not a steganography tool.</strong> When
you put data into an image, it will usually be very obvious.
</p>
<p>
The word/acronym "PNG" is pronounced "ping". This means that this tool
is called the "ping archiver". Really, you can call it whatever you
want. This is just some advice to help you avoid confusion later on.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Current Limitations</h3>
<p>
Currently, the tool can only handle 24-bit (8-bit depth) RGB and RGBA,
PNG's. The tool will eventually gain the ability to embed data into
any type of PNG (using larger areas of the image for images with lower
bit depth).
</p>
<p>
The library is currently not separated as a library from the
<code>pngarch</code> tool. This will be done before 1.0.
</p>
<h3>Why PNG?</h3>
<p>
PNG was selected because it is a non-lossy, standard image format
common on the Web. It uses the <a href="http://www.libpng.org"> libpng
</a> library to access the images.
</p>
<p>
JPEG could not be used because it is a lossy image format. GIF isn't
lossy, but it sucks (having only a limited 256 color palette). Why
would you want to use GIF for anything? (GIF animations are annoying,
so this does not count)
</p>
<p>
All data is stored in the visible pixels of the image; no data is
stored in the image meta data. This means that in most cases, you
could take a screenshot and extract the data directly from the
screenshot.
</p>
<!-- *************************************************************** -->
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
Currently, the tool can archive any file inside of a PNG file and
extract that file from the PNG into an identical file. Here are the
current command line switches,
</p>
<pre>
Usage: ./pngarch [OPTION ...] [FILE ...]

Options:

  -c, --create            Create PNG Archive
  -x, --extract           Extract PNG Archive
  -v, --verbose           Enable verbose output
  -b, --brief             Disable warnings
  -o, --output            Set the output file name (invokes -i)
  -X, --x-position        Distance of data from image left
  -Y, --y-position        Distance of data from image top
  -V, --version           Display version information
  -!, --help              Display this help text

Archiving Options:

  -n, --no-checksum       Do not add checksum to data
  -W, --data-width        Width of data in the image
  -H, --data-height       Height of data in the image
  -w, --img-width         Width of the image
  -h, --img-height        Height of the image
  -d, --bit-depth         PNG bit depth (8)
  -t, --color-type        PNG color type (rgb, palette)
  -i, --insert            Insert data into exiting images

Extraction Options:

  -l, --list              List internal filename
  -n, --no-checksum       Ignore bad checksums
  --auto-detect           Attempt to find image data automatically. (default)
  --no-auto-detect        Do not attempt to find image data automatically.
</pre>
<p>
The filename of the file archived in the PNG is stored within the PNG
itself. When extracting, the extracted data is put in a file with this
name. For example,
</p>
<pre>
$ pngarch my_file.txt
</pre>
<p>
will create a PNG file <code>my_file.txt.png</code>. Even if this file
is renamed, the PNG will know what file to extract to (-v is for
verbose, -l for list),
</p>
<pre>
$ mv my_file.txt.png a_file.txt.png
$ 
$ pngarch -l my_file.txt.png
my_file.txt.png
$ pngarch -v a_file.txt.png
Extracted my_file.txt
$ 
</pre>
<p>
The interface is very similar to <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">
<code>gzip</code></a>. When you don't tell it exactly what to do, it
will figure it out based on the file extension.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
All downloads, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">
md5</a> checksums can be found in <a href="files/">files/</a>.
</p>
<p>
There will not be any official binaries until at least release
1.0. Even at that point, there may not be any. However, due to the
complexity of building on w32, I may provide those binaries at that
time (if I can figure out how to build it for w32, or someone else
does it for me).
</p>
<h3>Alpha Release 0.2 (2007-07-01)</h3>
<p>
This release has much of the functionality desired for the coming 1.0
release. Read the NEWS file in the release for details.
</p>
<p>
Source tarball: 
<a href="files/pngarch-0.2.tar.gz">datpng-0.2.tar.gz</a> (79KB)<br />
Source PNG Archive (for fun):<br />
<img src="files/pngarch-0.2.png" alt="PNG Archive" /><br />
</p>
<p>
The source uses the GNU build system. To build the source you will
need a C compiler (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/"> gcc </a>
recommended), a bourne shell (such as <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"> bash </a>), and the libpng
library. You can compile with the regular commands:
</p>
<pre>
./configure
make
</pre>
<p>
You can install (with <code>make install</code>), but there is no need
to yet because you should only be using the tools for testing right
now.
</p>
<h3>Old releases</h3>
<h4>Alpha Release 0.1 (2007-06-18)</h4>
<p>
This is the first alpha release of the program. It lacks a lot of the
functionality that will be in release 1.0. The format of the data in
the PNG is subject to change. <strong>Images created with this release
are not readable in future releases.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Source tarball: 
<a href="files/pngarch-0.1.tar.gz">datpng-0.1.tar.gz</a> (79KB)<br />
</p>
<h3>Subversion Repository</h3>
<p>
You can also grab the latest source right from the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository:
</p>
<pre>
svn co http://svn.nullprogram.com/pngarch/trunk pngarch
</pre>
<p>
To build from the repository, you will need <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/"> autoconf </a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/"> automake </a>. To get
the build environment up to date, run the bootstrap script,
</p>
<pre>
./bootstrap
</pre>
<p>
Then you can go through the regular build process.
