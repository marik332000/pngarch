pngarch - store a file as visible data in a PNG image

[description]

pngarch, the PNG Archiver, stores a single file in a PNG image. This
file will (probably) look like random mess in the image. The image can
later be extracted using pngarch. The name of the file that was
archived is stored with the data right inside the image. The data in
the PNG image includes checksums, which will verify that data in the
image has not been corrupted.

The program behaves in a very similar way to gzip: when archiving a
file, the output image file name is the same as the input file, but
with `.png' appended. When pngarch is called with a file name with a
`.png' extension, pngarch will automatically attempt to extract an
image. The output file name is stored in the PNG itself and does not
depend on the name of the PNG file.

Data can be stored at any location inside the PNG image. This can be
set using the -XYWH options. With the -i or -o options, the data will
be inserted on top of the existing image file, if it exists. This
allows you to decorate a PNG archive ahead of time for later file
insertion.

When extracting a file, no positional information is needed. pngarch
will scan the file looking for valid data (with the help of the
built-in checksums).
