PNG Archiver

0.2 (07-01-07)
	* There is no longer a default image width. All images are
	automatically made square.

	* Now includes a header that does error checking and allows
	for a checksum (default). This header may not be readable by
	future versions.

	* All header information is stored in network (bigendian)
	order. This means that datpng now works across differing
 	architectures.	

	* As stated above, a checksum feature has been added. It
	checks for data integrity, which may be compromised by lossy
	format conversions.

	* Data can be placed at any position in the PNG image. This
	allows for decoration of the data with meta data. To retrieve
	this information, the exact location of the information does
	not need to be known. An autoscanner automatically finds the
	data.

	* An autoscan feature has been added. It attempts to find data
	in a PNG image automatically. It needs to be made more
	efficient, however. Autoscan works more reliably when a
	checksum is present.

	* A man page has been written for pngarch.

	* Support for RGBA (RGB with alpha) has been added. Support for
	palette images has begun, but it is incomplete. Only 8-bit
	images of these types are supported at the moment.

	* The license was upgraded to GPLv3. This is reflected in the
	COPYING file.

0.1 (06-18-07)
	* This is the first working prototype. It produces the
	simplest possible PNG archive: no checksum, support for only
	24-bit PNGs. This format will not be readable by future
	versions.
